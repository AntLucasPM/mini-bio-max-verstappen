      Max began his career in motorsport, competing in his first kart race at
      the age of 4. He began racing professionally in 2005, the year in which he
      won his first local championship. During his karting career, he competed
      against drivers such as George Russell and Charles Leclerc, with whom he
      had a strong rivalry.
