      Max Emilian Verstappen is a Dutch racing driver born on September 30, 1997
      (27 years old) in Hasselt, Belgium. He has been a Formula 1 driver since
      2015, making his debut for the Toro Rosso team. He is a four-time Formula
      1 champion in 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 and finished third in 2019 and
      2020 with Red Bull Racing, the team he has been racing for since 2016.
    </p>
    <h2>Start in Karting</h2>
    <p>
      Max began his career in motorsport, competing in his first kart race at
      the age of 4. He began racing professionally in 2005, the year in which he
      won his first local championship. During his karting career, he competed
      against drivers such as George Russell and Charles Leclerc, with whom he
      had a strong rivalry.
    </p>
    <p>
      By 2013, he had become one of the leading competitors in the sport, having
      accumulated victories in Dutch, Belgian, European, and world
      championships.

      His rise to single-seaters came in October 2013, shortly after Max turned
      16 and won six of the eight karting championships in which he competed. He
      drove a Manor Motorsport car at the Pembrey circuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then did another test, this time with a Dallara F311 from Motopark
      Academy. In January 2014, his participation in the Florida Winter Series
      was confirmed. Shortly after, he signed with Van Amersfoort Racing to
      compete in Formula 3. In July, he raced in Formula 3 Masters for Motopark.
      In F3, the Dutchman won ten races, being the only one to win six in a row.
    </p>
    <h2>F1</h2>
    <h3>Toro Rosso</h3>
    <p>On August 18, 2014, Scuderia Toro Rosso announced his signing for the 2015 season. He crashed a Red Bull RB8 model during an exhibition in the Netherlands.</p>
    <p>However, in only his second race in the category, Max achieved seventh place in the 2015 Malaysian Grand Prix, becoming the youngest driver to score points in Formula 1, at seventeen years and 180 days old. This record has yet to be broken.</p>
    <h3>Red Bull</h3>
    <h4>2016: Getting started at RedBull</h4>
    <p>On May 5th, 2016, days after the Russian Grand Prix, the Red Bull team replaced then-driver Daniil Kvyat with young Max Verstappen.</p>
    <p>In his first race with the team, at the 2016 Spanish Grand Prix, he achieved his best starting position—fourth place. During the race, he took second place after a collision between leaders Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg. He stayed on the track longer before his second tire change and took the lead on lap 44 after Daniel Ricciardo's tire change. He remained in the lead despite pressure from Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen until victory. With this result, he achieved four historic milestones in Formula 1: the youngest driver to lead a race, climb the podium, and win a race; by extension, he also became the first Dutchman to win in Formula 1. His record as the youngest driver to lead a lap was maintained until April 6, 2025, when Andrea Kimi Antonelli, who was 18 years, 7 months, and 12 days old (three days younger than Verstappen), led laps at the 2025 Japanese Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>At the 2016 Brazilian Grand Prix, Verstappen started in fourth place, but due to a mistake in tire choice, he plummeted to 14th. However, the Dutchman performed well in the rain, making several overtakes until he reached the podium, with his performance leading Gerhard Berger to compare him to Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher. In that race, Verstappen also set the fastest lap, and as he was 19 years and 44 days old at the time, he became the youngest driver to set the fastest lap in an F1 race, surpassing Nico Rosberg, who set the fastest lap at the 2006 Bahrain Grand Prix at 20 years, 8 months, and 13 days. Verstappen's record stood until 2025, when Kimi Antonelli, who was 18 years and 226 days old, set the fastest lap at that year's Japanese Grand Prix.</p>
    <h4>2017:</h4>
    <p>Verstappen continued to evolve in 2017, winning twice more: in Malaysia and Mexico, where he also became the youngest driver to lead an entire race, and also finished third in China and second in Japan. He would have secured another podium finish in the US, but was penalized for cutting corners and lost his place on the podium. He finished sixth.</p>
    <h4>2018: First victory in Austria </h4>
    <p>Verstappen had a good comeback season in 2018, accumulating eleven podium finishes, winning for the first time in Austria and for the second time in Mexico, finishing the year fourth in the drivers' championship and outperforming Ricciardo, who left the team at the end of the season. He finished fourth.</p>
    <h4>2019:</h4>
    <p>2019 saw even greater progress from the Dutchman. It was a special season for Max, who on August 3 secured his first pole position at the 2019 Hungarian Grand Prix, becoming the first Dutch driver to take pole and the 100th driver to start from the top spot on the grid. Verstappen won three times in 2019: in Austria, Germany, and Brazil, where he scored his second pole position, and made six more podium finishes, finishing third in the championship, his best position in his career to date.</p>
    <h4>2020: Great progress </h4>
    <p>2020 saw Verstappen mature, achieving 11 podium finishes in the 12 races he completed, but breakdowns prevented him from competing for the title. In the final race in Abu Dhabi, the Dutchman took his only pole position of the season and ended the year with a victory, but it was not enough to take the runner-up spot away from Mercedes driver Valtteri Bottas.</p>
    <h4>2021:First championship</h4>
    <p> In the 2021 season, considered the most competitive in recent times, Verstappen and Hamilton fought for the championship until the last round. His rival started in the lead, but Verstappen was hot on his heels. In the final race of the year at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, after Latifi's collision, Verstappen made his pit stop and put on new soft tires, while Mercedes and Hamilton chose to stay on the track with well-worn hard tires. Thus, shortly after the restart, Verstappen overtook Lewis Hamilton on the last lap, becoming the Formula 1 world champion.</p>
    <h4>2022 Two-time champion</h4>
    <p>The 2022 season seemed to be more difficult for Max, who had to deal with retirements in the early stages of the championship. However, the team recovered from its reliability issues, giving Verstappen the opportunity to win Grand Prix races. After overtaking Monegasque Charles Leclerc in the championship, he never left the top spot, achieving podium finishes and five consecutive victories in the French, Hungarian, Belgian, Dutch, and Italian Grand Prix races. And in the rainy and chaotic Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka, he became a two-time Formula 1 world champion. Two weeks later, on October 23, 2022, Max Verstappen won the United States Grand Prix, equaling the record set by Michael Schumacher (2004) and Sebastian Vettel (2013) of thirteen victories in a single year. This record was surpassed at the 2022 Mexican Grand Prix and extended in the last race of the 2022 season calendar, the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, with Verstappen setting the record for being the only driver to win fifteen races in a season.</p>
    <p>In March 2022, Verstappen and the Red Bull team announced the renewal of his contract, which will run until the end of 2028, as well as a huge salary increase. That year, Max Verstappen became the highest-paid driver in Formula 1. According to Forbes estimates, the driver received US$60 million in salary and bonuses from the Austrian team in 2022.</p>
    <h4>2023:Three-time champion, total dominance</h4>
    <p>In 2023, after winning the Spanish and Canadian Grand Prix, Max Verstappen achieved his 40th and 41st victories in his F1 career, respectively. With his latest victory, he equaled the number of victories achieved by legendary F1 driver Ayrton Senna.</p>
    <p>On August 27, 2023, Verstappen won the Dutch Grand Prix for the third consecutive time, equaling Sebastian Vettel's record of nine consecutive F1 victories dating back to 2013. A week later, he also won the Italian Grand Prix and claimed his tenth consecutive victory in a season, setting a new record.</p>
    <p>Max Verstappen won the Japanese Grand Prix and claimed his thirteenth victory of the season, breaking Michael Schumacher's record of twelve wins. His result secured the sixth F1 Constructors' title for his team, Red Bull Racing.</p>
    <h4>2024 Four-time champion</h4>
